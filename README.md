Unsuperwised-Learning-Assignment02-DBSCAN clustering
Attempt all questions in one notebook.



Problem Statement 1 [5 Marks]


Your task in this assignment is to:



Perform appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on the wine dataset [1 mark]
Apply DBSCAN clustering to the data and identify any outliers [2 marks]
After finding the best clustering solution and removing outliers, interpret some or all of the clusters and derive domain-specific insights from the results [2 marks]


Data: wine-clustering.csv



Clustering starter ideas:

- Experiment with different values of min_pts and eps in DBSCAN

- Try various feature scaling techniques before applying DBSCAN

- Visualize clusters and outliers using appropriate plots



Problem Statement 2 [5 Marks]


Your task in this assignment is to:



Perform appropriate EDA and preprocessing on the credit card usage dataset [1 mark]
Apply multiple clustering algorithms as specified below [2 marks]
Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms using a clustering metric of your choice [1 mark]
After finding the best clustering solution, interpret some or all of the clusters and derive domain-specific insights from the results [1 mark]


Data: credit_card_usage.zip



Clustering algorithms to apply:

a) Agglomerative clustering
b) DBSCAN
c) K-Means (as an additional algorithm)



Clustering starter ideas:

- For Agglomerative clustering: Experiment with different linkage methods (Single, Complete, Average) and distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine)

- For DBSCAN: Try different min_pts and eps values

- For K-Means: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters

- Visualize the clusters using appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques



Note:

- Include all experiments, EDA, and plots in your submission notebook.

- Do not limit your submission to the final algorithm that worked for you.

- Explain your reasoning for each step in the process.

- Use appropriate evaluation metrics to justify your clustering choices.

- Submit your work as a single Jupyter notebook. Do not submit zip files.

- The assignment notebooks will be run through a plagiarism checker. High plagiarism will be penalized.



Good luck!
